Build a responsive, accessible, themed site that demonstrates JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation:

variables & conditionals (name/age input);

reusable functions for a simple cart;

loops (forEach/for/while) to render content and a countdown;

DOM selection, events, and dynamic element creation/updates.
The layout is mobile-first using Grid + Flexbox, no frameworks, and includes a theme system with light mode persisted in localStorage.
